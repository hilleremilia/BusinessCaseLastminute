# Getting Started


> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of the project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run the app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of the project, and use one of the following commands to build and run the Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies.

The first time you run React Native project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see the app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run the app â€” you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.
